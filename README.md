# open-ruche

## Overview
"Open Ruche" is an academic university project focused on developing an IoT system for beehive monitoring. This innovative project aims to provide real-time data on beehive conditions such as temperature, humidity, and weight to support beekeepers and environmental researchers.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of beehive conditions.
- Data transmission to a cloud server for analysis.
- User-friendly interface for data visualization and alerts.

## Technology
- Arduino-based sensors for temperature, humidity, and weight.
- LoRa communication for efficient data transmission.
- Solar-powered system for sustainable operation.

## Installation
Instructions on setting up the "Open Ruche" system can be found in the 'Installation' section.

## Usage
